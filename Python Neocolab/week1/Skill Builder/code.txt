Q1. Anbu runs a shop near a school and hence sells a lot of pencils. Anbu wants to write a program to find the number of pencils sold every day. The program will accept the number of pencils at N at the beginning of the day and the number of pencils at E at the end of the day(N>=E). The program must print the number of pencils sold on that particular day.

N=int(input())
O=int(input())
print(N-O)

N=float(input())
print(round(N,2))

Q3. Write a program to read a decimal value and print it.

N=float(input())
print(N)

Q4. This code is supposed to take two numbers, divide one by another so that the result is equal to 1, and display the result on the screen. Unfortunately, there is an error in the code. Find the error and fix it, so that the output is correct.

numerator = 10
denominator = 10
result = numerator / denominator
print(result)

Q5. Perform the task given in program comments.

print('If you want to shine like a sun first burn like a sun')

Q6. The length l and breadth b of a rectangle as passed as input.The program must calculate the perimeter of the rectangle and print the perimeter as the output.Both L and B are positive integers.

L=int(input())
B=int(input())
Perimeter = 2*(L+B)
print(Perimeter)

Q7. Write a program to read a number and print it.

N=int(input())
print(N)

Q8. Perform the task given in program comments.

distance=245
time=8
speed= distance/time
print(round(speed,2))

Q9. Fill in the blanks so that the code prints 

Output: Arise awake and stop not till the goal is reached

word1 = " Arise"
word2 = " stop not "
word3 = " goal is "
print(word1, " awake and", word2, "till the", word3, "reached")

A=float(input())
B=float(input())
print(A*B)

Q11. Combine the variables to display the sentence "How do you like Python so far?"

word1 = "How"
word2 = "do"
word3 = "you"
word4 = "like"
word5 = "Python"
word6 = "so"
word7 = "far?"
print(word1, word2, word3, word4, word5, word6, word7, )
